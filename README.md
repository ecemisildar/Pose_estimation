# Pose Estimation

The project's aim is position and orientation estimation on Mars using images taken from the RGBD camera of a rover. 
To achieve this 2 known target objects around the rover are used. And using Convolutional Neural Networks this aim is achieved


The dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/louisburtz/learned-pose-estimation-robot-on-the-moon 
The code is inspired from https://github.com/TeamL3/learned-pose-estimation
